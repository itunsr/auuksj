/ > prunus sibirica (3) on the plateau in July, the most let a person enchanted is amorous armeniaca sibirica.
Walking plateau, as flowing in the girl's shame.
Don't want to seem like pearls of armeniaca sibirica fall to the ground, let it never embedded in the trees, to the barren loess, lit a lamp lights.
We are the sons of armeniaca sibirica, hold a family roots, pursuit of the beauty of the season, who knows?
Beauty belongs to the nature.
When I was a child, think oneself is very rich.
Dozens of apricot trees, such as dozens of magical story, attract me to listen.
They are, perhaps, is my wish and dream, I went to chase, to climb.
Highest belongs to the sparrow and the wind, I by hand the broken only weep or cry.
I often inadvertently fall of armeniaca sibirica pain, the performance of the concrete is holding a modest funeral, like buried the dead to apricot kernel with bleeding apricot meat in a match box, steal a couple of his father's cigarette paper as paper money, burn while buried in soil.
And of the sons of armeniaca sibirica this family is very large, it is in the wind childbirth, growth.
Shanxi south ditch on the bifurcation have their villages.
I has grown, there will always be their lingering in the view.
Their heart is like a shan-li person heart is full of wrinkles, hard, intoxicating.
Can show a spirit of apricot, apricot flower more simplicity, white jade.
Of armeniaca sibirica flower, heart, cold chest.
Poet Lin Bu xu mei "thin film QingJian extremely water, fragrant month at twilight."
I want to apricot flowers and may have in common, that is it resists the frost that shes spirit alone, armeniaca sibirica imports, we not bow for apricot flowers, her time.
Almond is old, less mau apricot flowers.
I let father go through the apricot trees for "family planning", father always fails.
, "he said," cut "the tree is very ache, old is that like, in order to eat a apricot can't kill.
I have to depend on him, because the almond trees is the only fortune grandpa left him.
Armeniaca sibirica in recent years gradually "rock", the apricot leather is Qian Xing nuclear is also money, mother see red in the face, a year to a season of apricot yellow leisure stay in apricot garden, father always scold her admire them to the old woman.
In fact, the father also another meaning of armeniaca sibirica wonder.
Gazing at his abstraction stay beside the almond trees, I think his inner dialogue with armeniaca sibirica, he put forward a lot of questions about life.
In this piece of barren land, stretched out his hand to people's diligent and kind of armeniaca sibirica.
It is a father all the life, is a part of my childhood.
When the summer wind blowing, I'm all alone language for it.
Burning in July, I have heard of armeniaca sibirica in blood flow, with rhythm, the voice telling the mountain people.
Armeniaca sibirica
The boring time, intermittent time, aggravating time, now, is a good dog, young voice as the furry body, so timid around only in the side, in your legs and rub to rub the past -- just little home, losing a mother's love, and pathetic little thing, now, arch with a small nose, desperately looking for, is your foreplay, gently caress - in fact, need not too much, only one hand is enough.
